Alright Harish — I thought about this deeply, and here’s the reality:

If you want **to double your salary in the next 3 months** *and* switch into a high-paying dev role, **Golang** can be a killer move — but only if you prepare in a **DSA + language + projects** integrated way.

Why?

* Golang is highly demanded in **backend, cloud, and distributed systems** (FinTech, SaaS, AI infra, DevOps tools).
* It pays better than MERN in many global companies.
* It’s simpler than Java/C++ but faster than Python — great for scale-heavy backends.
* Pairs perfectly with **AWS, microservices, and AI infra roles** you might target.

I’ll give you a **30-day Golang mastery + interview readiness plan**
(After 30 days, we’ll move into company-specific prep & high-paying role targeting).

## **Day-Wise Golang Prep Plan (30 Days)**

**Goal** → Be job-ready for backend + cloud interviews using Golang, while also preparing for DSA & system design.

---

### **Phase 1 – Golang Core (Day 1–7)**

**Objective:** Understand syntax, control flow, data types, and idioms.

**Day 1** – Setup & Basics

* Install Go & setup workspace (`go mod init`)
* Learn: `package main`, `import`, `fmt.Println`, variables (`var`, `:=`)
* Task: Print “Hello World” and a basic calculator.

**Day 2** – Data Types & Operators

* int, float, string, bool
* Arithmetic, logical, comparison
* Type casting
* Task: BMI calculator

**Day 3** – Control Flow

* if-else, switch, loops (`for`, `range`)
* Task: FizzBuzz in Go

**Day 4** – Arrays, Slices, Maps

* Arrays vs Slices (append, copy, len, cap)
* Maps (key-value store)
* Task: Count word frequency in a string

**Day 5** – Functions

* Parameters, return values, multiple returns
* Named returns, variadic functions
* Task: Implement a math utils package

**Day 6** – Structs & Methods

* Structs, attaching methods, pointers vs values
* Task: Create a `User` struct with `GetFullName` method

**Day 7** – Pointers & Error Handling

* `&`, `*`, dereferencing
* `error` type, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`
* Task: Division function with error handling

---

### **Phase 2 – Go for Backend (Day 8–14)**

**Objective:** Build API + database skills.

**Day 8** – Modules & Packages

* Organizing code in multiple files/folders
* Task: Create a math package and use it in `main.go`

**Day 9** – Concurrency Basics

* Goroutines (`go func`), Channels (`chan`)
* Task: Sum of numbers concurrently

**Day 10** – HTTP Server in Go

* `net/http`, request handlers
* Task: Basic “Hello API” endpoint

**Day 11** – REST API with CRUD

* JSON marshal/unmarshal
* Task: In-memory CRUD API for books

**Day 12** – Connecting to a Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)

* `database/sql` + `lib/pq` or `mysql` driver
* Task: CRUD API connected to DB

**Day 13** – Environment Variables & Config

* `.env` with `godotenv`
* Task: Secure DB connection

**Day 14** – Basic Middleware

* Logging, request timing
* Task: Log all API calls

---

### **Phase 3 – DSA in Golang (Day 15–21)**

**Objective:** Practice common interview problems in Go.

**Day 15** – Arrays & Strings

* Reverse string, Two Sum

**Day 16** – HashMaps & Sets

* Anagram check, Subarray sum

**Day 17** – Sorting & Searching

* Binary search, merge sort

**Day 18** – Stacks & Queues

* Valid parentheses, queue implementation

**Day 19** – Linked Lists

* Reverse linked list, detect cycle

**Day 20** – Trees & Graphs

* BFS, DFS, shortest path

**Day 21** – Dynamic Programming Basics

* Fibonacci, climbing stairs

---

### **Phase 4 – System Design + Advanced Go (Day 22–30)**

**Objective:** Be ready for backend/system design rounds.

**Day 22** – Interfaces & Dependency Injection
**Day 23** – Go Routines & Worker Pools
**Day 24** – Select Statement & Channel Patterns
**Day 25** – Context for Cancellation & Deadlines
**Day 26** – File Handling & JSON/YAML parsing
**Day 27** – Microservice Basics (gRPC / REST)
**Day 28** – Build a URL Shortener in Go (with DB)
**Day 29** – Design a Rate Limiter in Go
**Day 30** – Mock Interviews + Review

---

### **Key Extras to Boost Salary Potential**

* **Portfolio Projects:** At least 2–3 backend projects in Go (API + DB + concurrency).
* **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy Go APIs on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk / EC2 / Lambda).
* **Open Source:** Contribute to a Go project on GitHub for credibility.
* **Target Companies:** Remote-friendly backend/cloud-focused firms (Stripe, Coinbase, Cloudflare, etc.).

---

If you follow this 30-day Go + DSA + projects plan **while applying**, you can realistically target **₹8–12 LPA or even remote USD jobs** within 3–4 months.

---

If you want, I can now create a **90-day full “Go → High Paying Job” roadmap** that merges:

1. Golang mastery
2. Cloud skills
3. DSA prep
4. Resume/LinkedIn targeting high-paying backend roles

That will make it almost impossible to miss the 9+ LPA mark.

Do you want me to prepare that next?
