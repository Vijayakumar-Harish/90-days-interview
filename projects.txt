Nice — I thought this through. Below you’ll get **six full project blueprints** (MVP → stretch), each with: why it helps you get hired, exact tech stack, architecture, repo structure, step-by-step build plan, deployment + CI/CD, monitoring, test ideas, env variables, and interview talking points. Pick one to start and I’ll generate a ready-to-run **starter repo + README** for it.

# How to tackle these projects

Priority order I recommend (fastest impact → deepest skill proof):

1. **AI PDF Q\&A** (quick, shows RAG & embeddings)
2. **Finance Chatbot** (domain + fintech value)
3. **AI MERN App on AWS** (full-stack + microservices + deployment)
4. **Serverless AI API** (serverless & infra skills)
5. **AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard** (visualisation + infra)
6. **AI Fraud Detection System** (data + production ML; hardest, most valuable)

Start with project 1 & 2 to get portfolio wins fast, then 3–4 to show cloud, CI/CD, and 5–6 to demonstrate data/ML depth.

7. Add S3 storage and env-based config.
8. Dockerize backend + frontend.
9. Deploy to Render/EC2; add GitHub Actions for build + tests.

# Quick checklist to get started (first 7 days)

1. Pick 1 project (I recommend **AI PDF Q\&A**).
2. Create repo on GitHub with the folder skeleton I provided.
3. Implement skeleton endpoints (`/health`, `/upload`, `/ask`) with minimal return values.
4. Hook up OpenAI embeddings locally with a simple FAISS store.
5. Build minimal React UI to upload and ask questions.
6. Show me the repo link — I’ll review & provide PR-level feedback and a production-ready GitHub Actions pipeline.
